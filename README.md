# React Task Tracker

This is a simple React.js application which tracks a list of task entered by the user, these tasks remain in the json server database which act as a server side database. This project uses React.js class components and passing props through the components as this is a smaller application.

## Improvements and New Features

- Use the useContext hook to clean up the jsx, this also will allow for more features relating to tracking tasks

- Fields use DateTime pickers which can be used in a calendar
